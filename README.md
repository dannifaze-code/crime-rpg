# crime-rpg

This repo currently contains survivor asset packs plus a placeholder `index.html`
entry point. Replace `index.html` with your exported game build when you are
ready to publish.

> Note: This repository does not use git submodules; ensure CI does not attempt
> to initialize one for the removed `crime-rpg` entry.
